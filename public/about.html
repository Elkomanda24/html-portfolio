<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Mostafa Khaled, a passionate second-year Software Engineering student 
  at the Faculty of Computers and Information.
  I'm always excited about diving into the world of technology 
  and exploring how coding can solve real-world problems in creative ways.
</p>

<p>  Throughout my journey, I've completed several courses, including:
  <ul>
    <li>C++ Programming </li>
    <li>Information Systems</li>
    <li>Data Communication</li>
    <li>Information Technology </li>
    <li>Java Programming & OOP </li>
    <li>Project Management</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>Currently, I'm taking a Full Web Development course to level
  up my skills and bring my ideas to life in the digital world.
</p>
<p>
  On top of my technical skills, I've developed strong time management
  and problem-solving abilities. I'm great at team collaboration,
  and I thrive in fast-paced environments where I can challenge myself 
  and learn something new every day.
</p>

<p>
  I believe that technology is not just about codeâ€”it's about innovation,
   creativity, and making a positive impact. 
   I'm ready to contribute my skills to projects that matter 
   and grow as a developer.
